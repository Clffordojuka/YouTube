# YouTube Channel Analysis of Kenyan Content

This project focuses on scraping data from Kenyan YouTube channels and performing comprehensive analysis using SQL. We start by collecting data through the YouTube Data API, targeting popular channels like Citizen TV Kenya and others with substantial content relevant to the Kenyan audience. The dataset consists of key metrics such as video titles, view counts, publication dates, and more. After scraping and cleaning the data, it's stored in a MySQL database to enable efficient querying and exploration. The structured data allows us to uncover insights like the total views per channel, ranking of videos, growth patterns, and overall content engagement.

Using SQL, we conduct various analyses including aggregate functions, window functions, and subqueries to understand trends in viewership. Queries like calculating total and average views per channel, identifying top-performing content, and monitoring the growth of views over time provide a clear picture of how Kenyan YouTube channels are performing. Additionally, we use advanced techniques like ranking channels by views and categorizing them based on performance brackets. This project highlights how data from online platforms can be transformed into actionable insights through a combination of scraping, database management, and data analysis using SQL.
